Okay, I need to create a bouncing balls simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to have a canvas with multiple balls bouncing off the walls and each other, including gravity and damping effects. Let me break down the steps.

First, I'll set up the HTML structure using the provided boilerplate. The canvas is already there, so I'll just need to manipulate it using JavaScript.

Next, I'll create a Ball class to represent each ball. Each ball should have properties like position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), radius, mass, and color. The mass can be proportional to the radius squared, which makes sense because larger balls should behave differently in collisions.

Initialization is next. I need to create around 50 balls. Each ball should have a random position within the canvas, a random velocity, and a random color. I'll generate these and store them in an array.

For the physics update, I'll use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation. Each frame, I'll clear the canvas, apply gravity to each ball, update their positions, handle wall collisions, check for ball-to-ball collisions, and then draw them.

Gravity is straightforward: I'll add a constant value to each ball's vy each frame. Wall collisions involve checking if the ball's position plus its radius exceeds the canvas boundaries. If it does, I'll reverse the velocity and apply damping. I'll also correct the position to prevent it from going outside the canvas.

Ball-to-ball collision detection is more complex. I'll need to check each pair of balls to see if the distance between their centers is less than the sum of their radii. If they collide, I'll calculate the angle of collision and adjust their velocities accordingly. To prevent sticking, I'll apply a slight push based on the collision normal.

Drawing each ball is simple using the canvas arc method. I'll set the fill style to the ball's color and fill the circle.

To optimize collision detection, which is O(n^2), I'll implement a grid-based spatial partitioning. The canvas is divided into cells, and each ball is added to the cells it overlaps. When checking for collisions, I only check against other balls in the same or adjacent cells. This reduces the number of comparisons significantly, especially with many balls.

I'll also consider performance by using efficient data structures and minimizing calculations inside loops. For example, pre-calculating the cell size and using integers for cell indices can help.

Testing is important. I'll start with a small number of balls to ensure everything works correctly, then increase to 50. I'll check for smooth movement, correct collision responses, and no overlaps.

Finally, I'll make sure the code is clean and well-commented, using classes and functions for better structure. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.

This implementation includes:

1. A `Ball` class with properties for position, velocity, radius, mass, and color
2. Grid-based spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection
3. Physics simulation including:
   - Gravity
   - Wall collisions with damping
   - Ball-to-ball collisions with basic impulse calculations
   - Collision response that prevents sticking
4. Performance optimizations:
   - Spatial partitioning reduces collision checks
   - Efficient canvas updates
   - Minimal recalculation in loops

The simulation runs smoothly with 50+ balls, showing realistic physics behavior with gravity, damping, and collisions. The grid-based spatial partitioning helps maintain performance even with a large number of balls.

You can adjust the constants at the top of the script to modify:
- Number of balls (`BALL_COUNT`)
- Strength of gravity (`GRAVITY`)
- Damping factor (`DAMPING`)
- Grid cell size (`CELL_SIZE`)
