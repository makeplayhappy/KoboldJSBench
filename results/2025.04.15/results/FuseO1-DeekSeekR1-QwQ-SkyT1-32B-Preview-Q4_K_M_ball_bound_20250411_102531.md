Okay, I need to create a bouncing balls simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to have at least 30 balls interacting with each other and the container walls, including gravity, damping, and collisions.

First, I'll start by setting up the HTML structure. The boilerplate already has a canvas element, so I'll use that. I'll make sure the canvas is properly sized and centered on the page.

Next, I'll work on the CSS to ensure the canvas is displayed correctly without any overflow issues. The body should have no margins, and the canvas should have a border and background color for clarity.

Now, onto the JavaScript part. I'll need to create a Ball class to represent each ball. Each ball should have properties like position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), radius, mass, and color. The mass can be proportional to the square of the radius, which makes sense physically.

Initialization is next. I need to create around 50 balls. Each ball should start with a random position within the canvas, random velocity, and a random color. I'll generate colors using HSL for variety. To avoid initial overlaps, I'll check each new ball's position against existing ones, but I won't worry too much if some overlap initially as the collision response should handle it.

The animation loop will use requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering. In each frame, I'll clear the canvas, update each ball's position, handle collisions, and then redraw everything.

Gravity is applied by updating the vertical velocity of each ball. I'll add a constant gravity value each frame. Then, I'll update the position based on velocity.

Wall collision detection involves checking if a ball's position plus its radius exceeds the canvas boundaries. If it does, I'll reverse the velocity component and apply damping. Also, I'll correct the position to ensure the ball is inside the canvas.

For ball-to-ball collisions, the naive approach is to check every pair, which is O(n²). With 50 balls, that's manageable, but I should consider optimizations like spatial partitioning in the future. For each pair, I'll calculate the distance between centers and see if it's less than the sum of radii. If so, I'll handle the collision by calculating the impulse and updating velocities. I'll also adjust positions to prevent overlapping.

Drawing each ball is straightforward using the arc method in the canvas context. I'll fill each circle with the ball's color.

I need to make sure the simulation runs smoothly. Testing with 50 balls should be okay, but I'll keep an eye on performance. If it's too slow, I might implement a grid-based spatial partitioning to reduce collision checks.

Finally, I'll test the simulation to ensure all features work as expected: gravity makes balls fall, walls bounce with damping, and balls collide and bounce off each other without sticking.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll proceed to code each part step by step, making sure to handle edge cases and optimize where possible.
