Okay, I need to create a simple webgame where a character can be moved using the keyboard. The user provided a detailed set of requirements, so I should break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by setting up the HTML structure. The boilerplate already includes a canvas element, which is perfect for drawing the game. I'll need to make sure the canvas is properly sized and styled so it displays correctly in the browser.

Next, I'll define the Player object. The requirements specify that it should have position (x, y), size (width, height), speed, and possibly other properties like jumping ability. Since the character needs to jump, I'll include properties for velocity and gravity. The initial position should be at the bottom of the canvas so the character starts on the ground.

Now, handling keyboard input is crucial. I'll need to set up event listeners for keydown and keyup events to track which keys are pressed. Using a keys object to store the state of each key (like 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight', 'Space') will help manage the movement and jumping.

Acceleration and deceleration are part of the functional requirements. I'll implement this by adjusting the player's velocity based on the keys pressed. When moving left or right, the velocity increases up to a maximum speed. When no keys are pressed, the velocity decreases, simulating friction.

Jumping requires handling the vertical movement. I'll check if the spacebar is pressed and the player is on the ground before allowing a jump. Once jumped, the velocity in the y-direction will be adjusted, and gravity will pull the player back down.

Boundary checks are essential to prevent the character from moving off-screen. I'll ensure that the player's x-position doesn't go beyond the canvas width and that the y-position stays within the canvas height to handle landing.

In the game loop, I'll update the player's position based on velocity and handle collisions with the ground and walls. Drawing the player involves rendering a rectangle and an eye that changes position based on the direction the character is moving. If the character isn't moving, the eye centers.

I also need to make sure the movement is smooth and frame-rate independent. Using delta time in the velocity updates will help achieve this, ensuring consistent movement regardless of the frame rate.

Finally, I'll test each part as I goâ€”checking input handling, movement mechanics, jumping, and boundary conditions. Making sure all these elements work together seamlessly will result in a functional and enjoyable game.

Let's create a simple keyboard-controlled character webgame with movement, jumping, and boundary checks.
