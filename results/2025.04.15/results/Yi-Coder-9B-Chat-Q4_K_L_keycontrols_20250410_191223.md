Here is a basic example of how to implement this.

```javascript
var canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
var W = canvas.width;
var H = canvas.height;

var player = {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    speed: 10,
};

function drawPlayer() {
    ctx.clearRect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height);
    ctx.rect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height);
}

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
    drawPlayer();
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

function handleKeys(e) {
    var keyCode = e.which || e.keyCode;
    switch (keyCode) {
        case 37: // left arrow
        case 83: // a
            player.speed = -10;
            break;
        case 39: // right arrow
        case 68: // d
            player.speed = 10;
            break;
    }
}

document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeys, false);

// Start the loop
requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
```

You can refine this example based on your specific requirements.

Remember, this code doesn't include the implementation of the player's movement, which would require a thorough understanding of the JavaScript event loop.

Also, it doesn't include the handling of boundary checks - these would require you to implement a separate function that updates the player object's properties based on the current frame's dimensions and position.

The provided code gives you a starting point for implementing these features.

Finally, don't forget to add any necessary event listeners or handlers.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeys, false);
``` 

This will automatically trigger any time a key is pressed down.

You're free to modify this code to meet your specific needs.

Please note that this code doesn't cover all the functionalities mentioned in the task description. It's just a basic example of how you can achieve this. You need to modify and refine this code based on your specific requirements.

Also, you're advised to thoroughly test your final product to ensure it works as expected in all situations.


You can add more advanced functionalities such as diagonal movement, acceleration, and deceleration by modifying the player's speed dynamically based on the current state and inputs. 

Remember, complex movements require a deep understanding of the JavaScript event loop and efficient state management.

Finally, don't forget to add any necessary event listeners or handlers.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeys, false);
``` 

This will automatically trigger any time a key is pressed down.
