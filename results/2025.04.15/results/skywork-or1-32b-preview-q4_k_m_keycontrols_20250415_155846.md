Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to create a webgame where a character can be moved left and right using the keyboard, with features like jumping, acceleration, and boundary checks. The deliverable must be a single HTML file using plain JavaScript and Canvas.

First, I need to understand the requirements. The player object should have position, size, speed. Keyboard events for movement. The game loop handles updating position and drawing. Optional animation indicators. Then, functional requirements add jumping, acceleration, and handling multiple key presses. Desirable features include smooth movement and clear code structure.

Starting with the boilerplate code. The HTML has a canvas element with id gameCanvas. The script sets up the canvas context and has a gameLoop function using requestAnimationFrame. My code will go into the script section.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Define the Player object. The player needs x, y, width, height, speed. But since we have acceleration and jumping, maybe we need velocity and acceleration parameters. Also, gravity for jumping.

2. Set up keyboard event listeners. We need to track which keys are pressed. Using keydown and keyup to set a state (like a keys object with boolean values for 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight', ' ' for spacebar, etc.). WASD keys as well, so 'a' and 'd' should be handled.

3. The game loop will update the player's position based on the keys pressed. For movement: if left or a is pressed, accelerate left; if right or d, accelerate right. Then, apply velocity with delta time to get smooth movement. Also, apply friction (deceleration) when keys are not pressed.

4. Jumping: spacebar or up arrow. The player can jump, but only when on the ground. So need to track if the player is grounded. When jumping, apply a velocity upwards, and then gravity will bring them back down.

5. Boundary checks. The player should not move off the screen. So when updating x and y positions, ensure that the player's position stays within 0 <= x <= canvas.width - player.width, and similarly for y.

6. Drawing the player. The player is a rectangle. Optional: draw an eye indicating direction. When moving left, eye on left, right when moving right. If idle, center or hidden.

Let's start coding step by step.

First, define the player object. Let's set initial values. The player starts at the bottom, so y is H - 50 (assuming height 600, 50px height for player). Width 40px, height 50px. Speed can be 500 pixels per second. But with velocity, we'll need to use delta time. Also, acceleration and friction.

Wait, for smooth movement, using delta time is important. So in the game loop, we need to calculate the elapsed time since the last frame (deltaTime) and use that to update position. So velocity is in pixels per second.

So the player's properties:

- x, y: position
- width, height
- velocityX, velocityY
- speed: max speed
- acceleration: how fast to accelerate when pressing keys
- friction: deceleration when not pressing movement keys
- jumpForce: initial velocity when jumping
- gravity: acceleration due to gravity
- isGrounded: boolean to track if on the ground

Then, in the update loop, we handle input, apply acceleration, apply velocity, and check boundaries.

For keyboard input: create an object that tracks the state of the keys. For example, keys.ArrowLeft is true when the left arrow is pressed, etc. Listen to keydown and keyup events.

Now, in the game loop, during the update phase:

- Check which movement keys are pressed.
- Apply acceleration in the respective direction.
- Apply friction when not accelerating.
- Apply gravity (affects velocityY).
- Update position based on velocity and deltaTime.
- Check boundaries to prevent moving off-screen.

For the jumping mechanics: when the player is grounded and presses the jump key (space or up arrow), set velocityY to -jumpForce (negative because upward is negative y direction). Also, set isGrounded to false. When the player lands (y reaches the ground), set isGrounded back to true.

But how to detect landing? After updating the position, check if the player's y + height is >= H (the ground). If so, set y to H - height, and set isGrounded to true.

Now, handling multiple key presses: for example, pressing left and up. But in this case, movement is left and right, so maybe diagonal movement isn't applicable. Wait, the original task says "handle multiple key presses simultaneously (e.g., diagonal movement)". But the initial movement is left/right. So perhaps the acceleration allows for both left and right? But that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the problem is that when pressing left and right at the same time, the code should not allow movement. So in the code, we need to check which keys are pressed and apply acceleration accordingly.

Wait, for example, if both left and right are pressed, perhaps the movement is neutral. But in practice, when pressing left and right, the code should not accelerate in either direction. So in the movement logic, check if left is pressed (velocityX is negative) or right (positive), but not both.

So, for horizontal movement:

if (left is pressed and right is not pressed) {
   accelerate left
} else if (right is pressed and left is not pressed) {
   accelerate right
} else {
   apply friction
}

But perhaps the code can handle it by checking the keys and applying acceleration accordingly. For example, if left is pressed, add acceleration to the left (negative), if right is pressed, add acceleration to the right (positive). Then, after that, apply friction if the resulting velocity is not zero. Wait, but friction should only be applied when the player is not pressing any movement keys. Hmm.

Alternatively, when the player is pressing left or right, acceleration is applied. When not pressing, friction (deceleration) is applied. So, the code can check if any movement keys are pressed. If not, apply friction. Otherwise, apply acceleration if moving left or right.

But how to track that. Let's see:

let isMoving = keys.ArrowLeft || keys.ArrowRight || keys.a || keys.d;

Wait, but keys could be a object where each key (like 'ArrowLeft', 'a') is a property with true/false.

So, in code:

const leftPressed = (keys.ArrowLeft || keys.a);
const rightPressed = (keys.ArrowRight || keys.d);

if (leftPressed && !rightPressed) {
   player.velocityX -= player.acceleration * deltaTime;
} else if (rightPressed && !leftPressed) {
   player.velocityX += player.acceleration * deltaTime;
}

Then, clamp the velocity to player.speed (max allowed speed).

Then, apply friction (deceleration) if no movement keys are pressed. Wait, maybe friction is applied always, but only when the player is not pressing any movement keys. Wait, perhaps friction is a deceleration that acts when the player is not accelerating. So, for example, when you let go of the keys, the friction brings the player to a stop.

Alternatively, friction can be applied after applying acceleration. So, after applying acceleration from keys, apply friction. But that would cause the player to slow down even when pressing keys. That's not desired. So perhaps friction is applied only when no movement keys are pressed.

Hmm. Let's think: when the player is pressing left, acceleration is applied. When they let go, friction is applied. So, in code:

if (left or right is pressed) {
   apply acceleration
} else {
   apply friction
}

But how to check if any movement keys are pressed. So, if (leftPressed || rightPressed) { ... } else { apply friction }

Wait, but if both left and right are pressed, then neither acceleration is applied. So in that case, apply friction. But maybe that's not intended. But in practice, pressing both left and right would result in no movement, so friction would be applied. Which is correct.

So code:

if (leftPressed && !rightPressed) {
   accelerate left
} else if (rightPressed && !leftPressed) {
   accelerate right
} else {
   // apply friction to slow down
   player.velocityX *= (1 - player.friction * deltaTime);
}

Wait, but friction can be modeled as a deceleration. So, if the player is not pressing any movement keys, their velocityX is reduced by friction*deltaTime each frame. But perhaps it's better to multiply by (1 - friction * deltaTime), which would approach zero over time. Alternatively, subtract friction * deltaTime from velocityX, but clamp to zero if velocity is below a certain threshold.

Alternatively, we can model friction as a deceleration that brings the velocity to zero. So, if the player is moving and not pressing any keys, friction is applied to slow down.

So, perhaps:

if (leftPressed || rightPressed) {
   apply acceleration based on which key is pressed
} else {
   apply friction (deceleration)
}

But how to handle the deceleration. Let's model it as:

player.velocityX *= (1 - player.friction * deltaTime);

But this would reduce the velocity each frame by a factor. The friction would be a coefficient, like 0.8, but scaled by deltaTime to ensure frame independence.

Wait, but using multiplication can be better for smooth stopping. For example, applying a friction of 0.8 per second. So, each second, velocity is multiplied by 0.8. So over time, it approaches zero.

But to make it frame rate independent, we need to compute the factor based on deltaTime.

The formula would be:

frictionFactor = Math.pow(fric, deltaTime / 1000);

Where fric is the per-second factor. For example, if we want 0.8 per second, then each frame, the factor is 0.8^(deltaTime/1000). Because deltaTime is in milliseconds.

But perhaps that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, using linear deceleration. For example, friction is a value that represents how much to subtract from the velocity each frame. But then, we need to clamp the velocity to zero if it goes below.

But this can be done by:

if (velocityX > 0) {
   velocityX -= friction * deltaTime;
} else if (velocityX < 0) {
   velocityX += friction * deltaTime;
}

But then, if the friction is higher than the velocity, it would clamp to zero.

Alternatively, using:

velocityX *= (1 - friction * deltaTime);

Which smoothly approaches zero. This might be better for smooth movement.

So, in code, player.friction is a value like 0.8. Then, when no keys are pressed, velocityX is multiplied by (1 - 0.8 * deltaTime). This would cause the velocity to decrease exponentially.

But how to choose the friction value. Let's say we want the player to come to a stop within 500 milliseconds. So, after 500ms, velocity is about 1% of original. So, using a friction factor of 0.2 per second (since 0.2 * 500ms = 0.1, 1 - 0.1 = 0.9. So each second, multiply by 0.9^10 (for 1000ms) would be 0.348, which is a bit slow. Maybe higher friction is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using a friction of 10 per second. So, velocityX -= 10 * deltaTime. But then, if the velocity is 5, after 0.5 seconds, it would be 0. But this is linear. So, perhaps the code can use linear deceleration.

But which approach is better? Let's see. For example, if the player is moving at max speed and lets go of the key, they should come to a stop smoothly. Using multiplication approach may be better for smooth stops, as it's exponential decay.

But perhaps the acceleration and friction should be handled in the same way. So, when pressing left, acceleration is applied, and when not pressing, friction (deceleration) is applied. So, in code:

if (leftPressed) {
   player.velocityX -= player.acceleration * deltaTime;
}

if (rightPressed) {
   player.velocityX += player.acceleration * deltaTime;
}

Then, after that, clamp the velocity to the max speed.

But then, when not pressing any keys, the velocity remains the same. So, the player would coast to a stop. But we need to apply friction. So, perhaps after handling the key presses, apply friction.

Wait, maybe friction is a separate step. So:

player.velocityX *= (1 - player.friction * deltaTime);

But this would apply friction even when accelerating. Which is not desired. For example, if the player is pressing left, we want to accelerate left (negative velocity), but friction would also be applied. Which would slow down the acceleration.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct approach is:

- When a movement key is pressed, apply acceleration in that direction.
- When no movement keys are pressed, apply friction to slow down.

So, code:

if (leftPressed && !rightPressed) {
   player.velocityX -= player.acceleration * deltaTime;
} else if (rightPressed && !leftPressed) {
   player.velocityX += player.acceleration * deltaTime;
} else {
   // apply friction
   player.velocityX *= (1 - player.friction * deltaTime);
}

But then, if both left and right are pressed, it's treated as else, so friction is applied. Which would cause the player to slow down, even though both keys are pressed. But in reality, pressing both left and right should result in no movement. So that's correct.

But how to handle the keys. For example, if the player presses left and right at the same time, the code should not apply any acceleration, and apply friction. So the player's velocity would decrease towards zero.

But perhaps in that case, the player's velocityX is clamped to zero. But maybe that's not necessary, as the friction would slow them down. But if the player is moving and then presses both keys, they would come to a stop.

Alternatively, when both left and right are pressed, set velocityX to zero. But that might be too abrupt.

But according to the problem statement, handle multiple key presses. So, for example, if the player presses left and up (but up is for jumping). So in the movement code, left and right are handled, and up is for jumping.

So, back to the code. Let's proceed with the above approach.

Now, for jumping. The player can press space or up arrow. But only when grounded. So, in the update loop:

if (keys.Space || keys.ArrowUp) {
   if (player.isGrounded) {
       player.velocityY = -player.jumpForce;
       player.isGrounded = false;
   }
}

But need to handle the key press only once per press. Because if the player holds down the jump key, the code would keep applying the jump. But in reality, we want the jump to be applied once when the key is pressed. So, using the keydown event may cause multiple jumps if the key is held down. So, perhaps we need to track when the key is pressed and released.

Wait, but the way the code is structured, the keys object tracks whether the key is currently pressed. So, in the game loop, if the jump key is pressed (keys.Space is true), and the player is grounded, then apply the jump. But if the player holds down the space key, the code would apply the jump again when the player lands again. But that's correct.

Wait, no. Suppose the player is in the air, and holds the space key. When they land, the next frame, isGrounded is true, so the jump is applied again. So, the player can double jump. But according to the problem statement, the functional requirement is to implement jumping. There's no mention of allowing only one jump. So perhaps the code allows multiple jumps as long as the player is grounded when the jump key is pressed.

But in reality, in most platformers, you can jump only once when you are on the ground. So, the code as written would allow that. So, when the player is on the ground and presses the jump key, they jump. Once they are in the air, pressing jump again has no effect until they land again.

So that's correct.

Now, after applying the jump, the player's velocityY is set to -jumpForce (assuming upwards is negative y direction). Then, in each frame, gravity is applied by adding gravity * deltaTime to velocityY. So, the player accelerates downward due to gravity.

Then, when the player's y position + height exceeds the canvas height (H), we set their y to H - height, and set isGrounded to true.

But how to handle this in the code. After updating the position, check if the player is on the ground.

So, in the update step:

// Apply gravity
player.velocityY += player.gravity * deltaTime;

// Update position
player.x += player.velocityX * deltaTime;
player.y += player.velocityY * deltaTime;

// Boundary checks
player.x = Math.max(0, Math.min(player.x, canvas.width - player.width));
player.y = Math.max(0, Math.min(player.y, canvas.height - player.height));

// Check if grounded
if (player.y + player.height >= canvas.height) {
   player.y = canvas.height - player.height;
   player.isGrounded = true;
} else {
   player.isGrounded = false;
}

This way, when the player's feet (y + height) touch the ground (canvas height), they are set to the ground and isGrounded is true.

But what about other platforms? The problem statement doesn't mention platforms, so the ground is the canvas bottom.

Now, the drawing part. The player is a rectangle. For the optional animation, draw an eye on the left or right depending on movement direction. So, when the player is moving left (velocityX < 0), draw the eye on the left. When moving right (velocityX > 0), draw on the right. When idle, center or hidden.

So, in the draw phase:

ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height);

// Eye
let eyeX;
if (player.velocityX < -1) { // moving left
   eyeX = player.x + 5;
} else if (player.velocityX > 1) { // moving right
   eyeX = player.x + player.width - 15;
} else { // centered
   eyeX = player.x + player.width / 2 - 5;
}

ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(eyeX, player.y + 15, 3, 0, Math.PI * 2);
ctx.fill();

So, the eye is a small white circle. When moving left, placed 5 pixels from the left edge. When moving right, placed 15 pixels from the right edge (since the player's width is 40, 40-15=25, so eye at x+25). When idle, centered (x + 20 -5 = x+15? Wait, player.width is 40. So center is at x + 20. So eyeX would be 20 -5 = 15? Wait, perhaps the code should be:

eyeX = player.x + (player.width / 2) - 5;

So that the eye is centered. The 5 is to position it a bit to the left of the center. Maybe.

Alternatively, when idle, the eye is centered. So, eyeX = player.x + player.width / 2 - 5, eyeY is player.y + 15.

But perhaps the code can adjust these numbers for proper placement.

Now, putting all this together.

First, define the player object.

const player = {
    x: W/2 - 20, // center horizontally
    y: H - 50, // near the bottom
    width: 40,
    height: 50,
    velocityX: 0,
    velocityY: 0,
    speed: 500, // max speed in pixels per second
    acceleration: 1000, // acceleration per second
    friction: 0.8, // friction coefficient per second
    jumpForce: 1000, // jump velocity in pixels per second
    gravity: 500, // gravity acceleration per second
    isGrounded: true
};

Wait, speed is the max horizontal speed. So, after applying acceleration, we need to clamp the velocityX to -speed and speed.

So, after applying acceleration, we should clamp the velocity.

So, in the code:

player.velocityX = Math.max(-player.speed, Math.min(player.speed, player.velocityX));

But after applying acceleration from the keys.

So, in the update loop:

// Handle horizontal movement
const leftPressed = keys.ArrowLeft || keys.a;
const rightPressed = keys.ArrowRight || keys.d;

if (leftPressed && !rightPressed) {
    player.velocityX -= player.acceleration * deltaTime;
} else if (rightPressed && !leftPressed) {
    player.velocityX += player.acceleration * deltaTime;
}

// Apply friction if not moving
if (!(leftPressed || rightPressed)) {
    player.velocityX *= (1 - player.friction * deltaTime));
}

// Clamp velocityX to max speed
player.velocityX = Math.max(-player.speed, Math.min(player.speed, player.velocityX));

Wait, but friction is applied even when acceleration is applied. Wait, no. The code first applies acceleration based on the keys, then applies friction if no keys are pressed. So, if a key is pressed, friction is not applied. So that's correct.

Wait, no. The code applies acceleration if left or right is pressed. Then, applies friction only if neither is pressed. So, when a key is pressed, friction is not applied. So, acceleration and friction are mutually exclusive. That's correct.

But perhaps the code should apply friction even when accelerating. For example, if the player is moving right and presses left, but that's handled by the key checks.

Alternatively, perhaps the friction is only for when the player is not pressing any movement keys. So the code as written is correct.

Now, jumping:

if (keys.Space || keys.ArrowUp) {
    if (player.isGrounded) {
        player.velocityY = -player.jumpForce;
        player.isGrounded = false;
    }
}

But this would allow the player to jump again if they press the jump key again while in the air, but only when they are grounded. So, when they land, isGrounded is set to true again.

Now, applying gravity:

player.velocityY += player.gravity * deltaTime;

So, gravity pulls the player down.

Now, updating the position:

player.x += player.velocityX * deltaTime;
player.y += player.velocityY * deltaTime;

Then, boundary checks:

player.x = Math.max(0, Math.min(player.x, W - player.width));
player.y = Math.max(0, Math.min(player.y, H - player.height));

But after that, check if the player is on the ground. Because the player's y could be clamped to the ground.

if (player.y + player.height >= H) {
    player.y = H - player.height;
    player.isGrounded = true;
} else {
    player.isGrounded = false;
}

Now, the code for the game loop.

In the gameLoop function, we need to track the delta time. So, the first frame, we have no previous time, so delta is 0. Then, subsequent frames calculate delta as currentTimestamp - lastTimestamp.

So, in the gameLoop:

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
    if (!lastTimestamp) {
        lastTimestamp = timestamp;
    }
    const deltaTime = timestamp - lastTimestamp;
    lastTimestamp = timestamp;

    // Update player state
    updatePlayer(deltaTime);
    // Draw player
    drawPlayer();

    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

But we need to declare lastTimestamp as a variable.

Let me structure the code:

In the script section:

// Player object
const player = { ... };

// Keys state
const keys = {
    ArrowLeft: false,
    ArrowRight: false,
    Space: false,
    ArrowUp: false,
    a: false,
    d: false
};

// Event listeners
window.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
    if (keys[e.key]) {
        return;
    }
    keys[e.key] = true;
    e.preventDefault();
});

window.addEventListener('keyup', (e) => {
    if (!keys[e.key]) {
        return;
    }
    keys[e.key] = false;
    e.preventDefault();
});

// Last frame timestamp
let lastTimestamp = 0;

function updatePlayer(deltaTime) {
    // Handle horizontal movement
    const leftPressed = keys.ArrowLeft || keys.a;
    const rightPressed = keys.ArrowRight || keys.d;

    // Apply acceleration
    if (leftPressed && !rightPressed) {
        player.velocityX -= player.acceleration * deltaTime;
    } else if (rightPressed && !leftPressed) {
        player.velocityX += player.acceleration * deltaTime;
    }

    // Apply friction if no keys pressed
    if (!(leftPressed || rightPressed)) {
        player.velocityX *= (1 - player.friction * deltaTime);
    }

    // Clamp velocityX to max speed
    player.velocityX = Math.max(-player.speed, Math.min(player.speed, player.velocityX));

    // Jumping
    if ((keys.Space || keys.ArrowUp) && player.isGrounded) {
        player.velocityY = -player.jumpForce;
        player.isGrounded = false;
    }

    // Apply gravity
    player.velocityY += player.gravity * deltaTime;

    // Update position
    player.x += player.velocityX * deltaTime;
    player.y += player.velocityY * deltaTime;

    // Boundary checks
    player.x = Math.max(0, Math.min(player.x, W - player.width));
    player.y = Math.max(0, Math.min(player.y, H - player.height));

    // Check if grounded
    if (player.y + player.height >= H) {
        player.y = H - player.height;
        player.isGrounded = true;
    } else {
        player.isGrounded = false;
    }
}

function drawPlayer() {
    // Clear canvas
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, W, H);

    // Draw player
    ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
    ctx.fillRect(player.x, player.y, player.width, player.height);

    // Draw eye
    let eyeX;
    if (player.velocityX < -1) {
        eyeX = player.x + 5;
    } else if (player.velocityX > 1) {
        eyeX = player.x + player.width - 15;
    } else {
        eyeX = player.x + player.width / 2 - 5;
    }

    ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(eyeX, player.y + 15, 3, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    ctx.fill();
}

// Start the game loop
requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

Wait, but the clearRect is called in the drawPlayer function, which is called every frame. That's correct.

Now, testing this code. The player should move left and right with arrow keys or WASD, jump with space or up arrow. Acceleration and deceleration are applied. The eye moves based on direction.

But need to check the numbers. Let's see:

Player's initial position is W/2 - 20 (since width is 40). So centered horizontally. Y is H -50 (canvas height is 600), so 550. Player's height is 50, so the bottom of the player is at 550 +50=600, which is the canvas height. So initially, the player is grounded.

When jumping, velocityY is set to -1000 (if jumpForce is 1000). Then, gravity adds 500 * deltaTime each frame. So, the jump arc should be parabolic.

But perhaps the numbers are too large. Let's see. With acceleration of 1000 pixels per second, pressing left or right will accelerate the player to reach max speed of 500 pixels per second. So, it takes 0.5 seconds to reach max speed. That might be too slow. Maybe the acceleration should be higher. But that's up to testing.

Alternatively, perhaps the acceleration should be 500, max speed 700. But these values can be adjusted for better feel.

Now, possible issues:

- The player can jump again while in the air if the code allows. But according to the code, only when isGrounded is true. So, no.

- The
