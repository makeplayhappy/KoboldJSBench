Okay, I need to create a simple web game where a character can be controlled with the keyboard. The user provided specific requirements, so I'll go through each one step by step.

First, the goal is to have a character that moves left and right using arrow keys or WASD. I should prevent it from moving off-screen. Also, optionally, the character should face the direction it's moving. The requirements mention defining a Player object with position, size, and speed. So I'll start by setting up the Player class with these properties.

Next, I need to handle keyboard events. I'll set up event listeners for keydown and keyup to track which keys are pressed. Using an object to keep track of the keys makes sense, so I'll initialize keys like 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight', 'w', 'a', 's', 'd'.

The game loop is essential. In each frame, I'll check the state of the keys, update the player's position, handle boundaries, and draw everything. For smooth movement, using delta time is a good idea, so I'll calculate deltaTime based on the timestamp parameter in requestAnimationFrame.

For movement, I'll consider both horizontal and vertical directions. The user mentioned adding jumping, so I'll include a jump method that changes the player's velocity when the spacebar is pressed. I'll also handle acceleration and deceleration, so the player doesn't move at a constant speed but slows down when keys are released.

Boundary checks are crucial. I'll ensure the player doesn't go beyond the canvas edges by clamping their position. Also, when the player is on the ground, I'll reset their velocity to prevent floating.

Drawing the character involves rendering a rectangle and an eye that changes position based on movement direction. If the player is moving left, the eye is on the left; if right, on the right. If idle, it's centered.

I'll also add a ground platform to give a sense of the environment. This will help in visualizing the jumping mechanics.

Putting it all together, I'll initialize the player, set up event listeners, and start the game loop. In each loop iteration, I'll update the player's state, handle inputs, apply physics, and redraw everything.

I need to make sure the code is clean and well-structured. Using classes and functions will help organize the code. I'll also include comments where necessary for clarity.

Testing each feature as I go is important. I'll check if the player moves correctly, jumps, and stays within boundaries. I'll also ensure that the eye indicator works as intended.

Finally, I'll review the code to make sure it meets all the requirements and runs smoothly in a browser without any external libraries.

I'll help you create this web game. The code below implements all the core requirements and adds some desirable features:

```

This implementation includes:

1. A `Player` class with position, velocity, and movement logic
2. Keyboard controls for movement (left/right using arrow keys or WASD) and jumping (space bar)
3. Smooth acceleration and deceleration
4. Jump mechanics with gravity
5. Direction indicator (a white "eye" that moves based on direction)
6. Boundary collision detection
7. Ground detection and reset of vertical velocity
8. Simple visual styling

The character will:
- Accelerate when holding movement keys
- Decelerate when releasing movement keys
- Jump when pressing space bar
- Stay within screen boundaries
- Show a visual indicator of movement direction

The notes section explains controls and lists implemented features.

To play:
1. Use left arrow or A to move left
2. Use right arrow or D to move right
3. Press space to jump

The character will move smoothly and stay within the screen boundaries while responding to input commands.
