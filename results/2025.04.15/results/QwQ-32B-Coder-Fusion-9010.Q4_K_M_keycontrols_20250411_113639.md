Step 1: Define Player Object
- Create Player class or object with properties: x, y, width, height, speed, velocityX, isJumping, jumpVelocity.
- Set initial position and dimensions.

Step 2: Set Up Canvas and Context
- Get canvas element by ID.
- Get 2D rendering context.

Step 3: Handle Keyboard Events
- Use event listeners for keydown and keyup events.
- Track which keys are currently pressed.

Step 4: Implement Game Loop
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation.
- Update player position based on velocity and time delta.
- Apply gravity if jumping.
- Check for collisions with ground.

Step 5: Drawing
- Clear canvas each frame.
- Draw player at updated position.
- Optionally, draw other elements like ground.

Step 6: Jumping Mechanics
- Allow player to jump by setting jumpVelocity.
- Apply gravity to bring player back down.
- Prevent multiple jumps in air.

Step 7: Acceleration and Deceleration
- Adjust velocity based on keys pressed.
- Implement friction to slow down player over time.

Step 8: Boundary Checks
- Prevent player from moving beyond canvas edges horizontally.
- Ensure player stands on ground when not jumping.

Step 9: Diagonal Movement
- If needed, handle combinations of movement keys for diagonal movement.

Step 10: Testing and Debugging
- Test movement controls.
- Check for smooth animation.
- Ensure no glitches in jumping or boundary behavior.

Step 11: Refine Code
- Optimize performance if necessary.
- Add comments for clarity.
- Consider encapsulating logic in functions for better readability.

Step 12: Finalize and Deploy
- Test on different browsers if possible.
- Make sure all features work as intended.
- Save and share the HTML file.

**Final Solution**
To create a simple webgame where a character can be moved left and right using the arrow keys or WASD, and can jump, follow these steps:

### Approach

1. **Define the Player:** Create a player object with properties like position, size, speed, and velocity.
2. **Keyboard Input Handling:** Use `keydown` and `keyup` events to track which movement keys are pressed.
3. **Game Loop:** Use `requestAnimationFrame` to continuously update and render the game state.
4. **Movement Logic:** Update the player's position based on velocity and handle acceleration, deceleration, and jumping.
5. **Boundary Checks:** Ensure the player stays within the canvas boundaries.
