Okay, I need to create a bouncing balls simulation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Canvas API. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the HTML skeleton is provided. I'll need to work within that. The main elements are the canvas and the script section. The goal is to have at least 30 balls bouncing around with gravity, damping, and collisions.

Starting with the Ball class. Each ball needs properties like position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), radius, mass, and color. The mass can be proportional to the radius squared, so I'll set mass = Math.PI * r*r. Colors can be random.

Initialization: Create 50 balls. Their initial positions should be random within the canvas, but I need to avoid overlapping. Hmm, that might be tricky. Maybe just generate a random position and check if it's not overlapping with existing balls. But with 50 balls, this could take time. Maybe for simplicity, just place them randomly and let the collision detection handle overlaps later. The problem says it's okay if they start overlapping, so that's manageable.

The animation loop uses requestAnimationFrame. The loop needs to clear the canvas each frame, update all balls, handle collisions, then draw them.

Gravity: Each frame, add gravity to the vy of each ball. Let's say gravity is 0.3 or something. Then update positions using x += vx, y += vy.

Wall collisions: For each ball, check if it's touching the edges. The edges are the canvas boundaries. So for x, check if x - r < 0 or x + r > canvas.width. Similarly for y. When a collision occurs, reverse the velocity component (vx or vy) and apply damping (multiply by a factor like 0.8). Also adjust the position to prevent sticking. For example, if the ball is left of the wall, set x = r.

Ball-to-ball collisions are more complex. The naive approach is O(n^2), which is slow for 50 balls. To optimize, maybe use a grid system. Divide the canvas into cells, and for each ball, check collisions only with balls in the same or adjacent cells. That reduces the number of pairs to check.

Let me think about the grid. Let's say the grid has cells of size 100x100. Each ball is in the cell corresponding to its position. When checking for collisions, a ball only needs to check neighbors in adjacent cells. But implementing this might take some time. Alternatively, maybe for the first pass, just do the O(n^2) check but see if it's manageable. Let's see, 50 balls would have 50*49/2 = 1225 pairs per frame. That might be okay with some optimizations. But to get better performance, the grid is better.

Alternatively, maybe use a spatial hash. Let's try the grid approach. Let's create a grid array where each cell holds references to the balls in that cell. Each frame, first update all balls' positions, then update their grid positions, then check collisions in the grid.

So steps for collision detection between balls:

1. Update each ball's position (after applying gravity and velocity).
2. For each ball, determine which grid cell it's in.
3. Place each ball in the grid's cell array.
4. For each cell, check all pairs of balls in that cell, and adjacent cells, for collisions.
5. Handle collisions between those pairs.

This way, we only check pairs within the same or nearby cells, reducing the number of checks.

Now, the collision response. When two balls collide, we need to resolve their velocities. The standard elastic collision equations would be best, but maybe simplified. Let's recall the formulas.

The formula for elastic collisions between two balls:

Let’s denote ball A and B.

Let’s have their positions (x1, y1), (x2, y2), velocities (vx1, vy1), (vx2, vy2), masses m1, m2.

The vector between them is (dx, dy) = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1). The distance squared is dx² + dy². The unit vector in the direction of the collision is (dx, dy) normalized.

The relative velocity along that direction is ( (vx2 - vx1)*dx + (vy2 - vy1)*dy ) / distance.

Then, the impulse calculation would involve this. But maybe a simpler way is to swap velocities in the direction of the collision, but scaled by their masses.

Alternatively, here's a simplified approach:

When two balls collide, we can compute the normal vector (direction from A to B), then compute the relative velocity along that normal. Then, using the masses, compute the impulse and adjust velocities accordingly. But this might get a bit involved.

Alternatively, a common approximation is to swap the velocities, but scaled by their masses. Wait, maybe better to use the standard equations.

The formula for the new velocities after collision:

Let’s denote:

var dx = b2.x - b1.x;
var dy = b2.y - b1.y;
var dist = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
var nx = dx/dist;
var ny = dy/dist;

var relativeVelocity = (b2.vx - b1.vx)*nx + (b2.vy - b1.vy)*ny;

var combinedMass = b1.mass + b2.mass;

var impulse = ( (relativeVelocity) * (1 + 1) ) / combinedMass; // assuming coefficient of restitution is 1 (elastic), but maybe 0.9 for damping.

Wait, the coefficient of restitution (COR) affects this. Let's say COR is 0.8. Then:

impulse = -(1 + COR) * relativeVelocity / ( (1/m1) + (1/m2) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Alternatively, here's a method:

The change in velocity for each ball is:

deltaV1 = ( (2 * m2) / (m1 + m2) ) * ( (vx2 - vx1)*nx + (vy2 - vy1)*ny ) * nx, ny components.

Wait, perhaps better to use the standard elastic collision equations.

The standard approach is:

Let’s compute the normal vector (nx, ny) pointing from A to B.

The relative velocity along the normal is v_rel = ( (vx2 - vx1)*nx + (vy2 - vy1)*ny )

The impulse is J = -(1 + COR) * v_rel / ( (1/m1) + (1/m2) )

Then, the velocity changes are:

deltaV1 = (J / m1) * (nx, ny)

deltaV2 = -(J / m2) * (nx, ny)

So applying this:

vx1 += deltaV1.x

vy1 += deltaV1.y

vx2 -= deltaV2.x

vy2 -= deltaV2.y

Wait, maybe the signs need to be checked. Let me think again.

Alternatively, here's a step-by-step approach:

Compute the normal vector (nx, ny) between the centers.

Compute the relative velocity along the normal:

v_rel = ( (b2.vx - b1.vx)*nx + (b2.vy - b1.vy)*ny )

The impulse is J = -(1 + COR) * v_rel / ( (1/m1) + (1/m2) )

Then:

b1.vx += (J / m1) * nx

b1.vy += (J / m1) * ny

b2.vx -= (J / m2) * nx

b2.vy -= (J / m2) * ny

Wait, perhaps the direction is important here. Let me see.

Alternatively, here's a resource I recall: the standard formula for elastic collision in 2D.

The formula for the new velocities is:

v1' = v1 - (2*m2)/(m1+m2) * ( (v1 - v2) • n ) * n

v2' = v2 - (2*m1)/(m1+m2) * ( (v2 - v1) • n ) * n

Where n is the unit normal vector from m1 to m2.

Hmm, perhaps that's better.

Alternatively, here's code I can use from some examples.

Alternatively, let's proceed with the following approach for simplicity:

When two balls collide, we can compute the normal vector between them, then adjust their velocities so that they move away from each other, with some damping.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

Compute the direction vector between the two balls (dx, dy).

Compute the distance between them (d). Since they are overlapping, we can compute how much they are overlapping (overlap = sumRadii - d). Then, move them apart by half the overlap each.

But for velocity, we can compute the normal direction (dx, dy divided by d), then compute the relative velocity along that direction. Then, reverse that component with damping.

Alternatively, to resolve the collision:

1. Compute the normal vector pointing from A to B (dx, dy). Normalize it to get (nx, ny).

2. Compute the relative velocity along the normal: v_rel = (vx2 - vx1)*nx + (vy2 - vy1)*ny.

3. The impulse is J = -(1 + COR) * v_rel / ( (1/m1) + (1/m2) )

4. Apply the impulse to both balls.

This should handle the velocity change.

The COR (coefficient of restitution) is the bounciness. Let's set it to 0.8 for damping.

Now, implementing this in code.

Now, for the grid system:

First, define the grid size. Let's say each cell is 100x100. The grid's dimensions would be (canvas.width / cellSize) by (canvas.height / cellSize). So for an 800x600 canvas, that's 8 cells wide and 6 tall.

Each frame:

- Clear the grid.

- For each ball, compute which cell it is in (x_cell = Math.floor(b.x / cellSize), same for y).

- Place the ball in the grid's cell array.

Then, for each cell, check all balls in that cell and adjacent cells (up to 8 surrounding cells) for collisions.

Wait, but how to do this efficiently?

Alternatively, for each ball, look at its current cell and adjacent cells, and check all balls in those cells.

But this might still be O(n^2) in the worst case, but with better average performance.

Alternatively, for each ball, iterate through all balls in the same cell and adjacent cells, but make sure to not check the same pair twice.

Alternatively, for each cell, for each ball in the cell, check against all other balls in the same cell and adjacent cells.

But this could be manageable.

Alternatively, here's a possible structure:

Initialize a grid array, where each cell is an array of balls.

Loop over all balls:

For each ball, compute its cell.

Add it to the grid's cell array.

Then, after building the grid, loop over each cell in the grid:

For each ball in the cell, check collisions with other balls in the same cell and adjacent cells.

But to avoid duplicates, perhaps only check balls that are after the current one in the list, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, for each ball in the cell, check against all balls in the same cell and adjacent cells, but skip pairs already checked.

Hmm, this could get a bit tricky. Maybe for simplicity, just check all pairs in the same cell and adjacent cells, and handle duplicates, but since the number is reduced, it's manageable.

Now, coding steps.

First, define the Ball class.

class Ball {

	constructor() {

		this.x = Math.random() * (W - 2*r) + r; // Random position within canvas, considering radius.

		this.y = Math.random() * (H - 2*r) + r;

		this.vx = (Math.random() * 2 - 1) * 5; // Random initial velocity.

		this.vy = (Math.random() * 2 - 1) * 5;

		this.r = Math.random() * 20 + 10; // Radius between 10-30?

		this.mass = Math.PI * this.r * this.r; // Mass proportional to area.

		this.color = `rgb(${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255}, ${Math.random()*255})`;

	}

}

Wait, but the radius can vary. That might complicate collision detection, but it's okay.

Wait, the problem says "potentially with varying radii and colors". So that's acceptable.

Now, creating an array of balls:

const balls = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
	balls.push(new Ball());
}

But how to set the radius. Maybe set r between 10 and 30.

Wait, in the Ball constructor:

this.r = Math.random() * 20 + 10; // 10 to 30.

But then, when placing the initial positions, need to ensure they are within the canvas. So x must be between r and W - r, similarly for y.

Yes, the initial x is set as (Math.random()*(W - 2*r) + r). So that's okay.

Now, the animation loop.

The gameLoop function will handle:

- Clear canvas.

- Update each ball's position (apply gravity, velocity, then check wall collisions).

Wait, the order is important. The process is:

Each frame:

1. Clear canvas.

2. For each ball:

   a. Apply gravity to vy (vy += gravity).

   b. Update position (x += vx, y += vy).

   c. Check for wall collisions and handle them (reverse velocity with damping, adjust position).

3. After all balls have moved, handle ball-to-ball collisions.

Wait, the ball-to-ball collision detection must be done after all balls have moved, because their positions are updated before checking for collisions between them.

So the steps are:

- Update all balls' positions (including gravity and velocity) and handle wall collisions first.

Wait, no. Because when handling wall collisions, you have to first move the ball, then check for walls. Wait, the process for each ball is:

Apply gravity (vy += gravity).

Update position (x += vx, y += vy).

Then check for wall collisions and adjust accordingly.

So for each ball, the wall collision is handled immediately after moving.

But for ball-to-ball collisions, you need to process all the balls' new positions first, then check for overlaps between them.

So the order is:

1. Clear the canvas.

2. For each ball:

   a. Apply gravity: vy += gravity.

   b. Update position: x += vx; y += vy.

   c. Check for wall collisions, adjust velocity and position.

3. Now, after all balls have been moved and wall collisions handled, process ball-to-ball collisions.

4. Draw all balls.

So the ball-to-ball collision handling is done after all individual movements and wall checks.

This way, when checking for ball collisions, all balls are in their new positions (after wall handling).

Now, the ball-to-ball collision detection:

First, build the grid.

Let me define cellSize as 100.

const cellSize = 100;

Then, create a grid array. The grid's dimensions are:

const gridWidth = Math.ceil(W / cellSize);

const gridHeight = Math.ceil(H / cellSize);

The grid is a 2D array: grid[y][x] ?

Wait, perhaps:

grid is an array of rows, each row is an array of columns.

var grid = new Array(gridHeight);

for (var y = 0; y < gridHeight; y++) {

    grid[y] = new Array(gridWidth);

    for (var x = 0; x < gridWidth; x++) {

        grid[y][x] = [];

    }

}

Wait, but in JavaScript, perhaps better to initialize as:

grid = Array.from({length: gridHeight}, () => Array.from({length: gridWidth}, () => []));

But for each frame, we need to rebuild the grid.

So in the collision detection phase:

First, clear the grid.

for (var y = 0; y < gridHeight; y++) {

    for (var x = 0; x < gridWidth; x++) {

        grid[y][x].length = 0;

    }

}

Then, for each ball in balls:

Compute the cell indices:

var cellX = Math.floor(ball.x / cellSize);

var cellY = Math.floor(ball.y / cellSize);

But need to clamp to grid dimensions. Because if ball.x is exactly at W, then cellX could be gridWidth, which is beyond the array. So:

cellX = Math.min( Math.floor(ball.x / cellSize), gridWidth -1 );

Same for cellY.

Then, add the ball to grid[cellY][cellX].

Once all balls are placed in the grid, then for each cell in the grid, check the balls in that cell and adjacent cells.

For each cell (y, x):

for (var yCell = 0; yCell < gridHeight; yCell++) {

    for (var xCell = 0; xCell < gridWidth; xCell++) {

        // Get the balls in this cell.

        var currentCellBalls = grid[yCell][xCell];

        // Now, check current cell and adjacent cells.

        // Iterate over all adjacent cells (including current cell)

        // For each adjacent cell (dy, dx):

        // But perhaps iterate over the current cell and all 8 surrounding cells.

        // To limit, check current cell and cells in a 3x3 grid around it.

        for (var dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++) {

            for (var dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++) {

                var neighborY = yCell + dy;

                var neighborX = xCell + dx;

                // Check if neighbor is within grid bounds.

                if (neighborY < 0 || neighborY >= gridHeight || neighborX < 0 || neighborX >= gridWidth) {

                    continue;

                }

                // Get the neighbor's balls.

                var neighborCellBalls = grid[neighborY][neighborX];

                // Now, for each ball in currentCellBalls, check against each ball in neighborCellBalls.

                // But to avoid duplicates, only check balls in neighborCellBalls that are after the current ball's list?

                // Hmm, perhaps it's easier to loop through all pairs, but that could lead to duplicates.

                // Alternatively, for the current cell and neighbor cell, loop through all pairs in currentCellBalls and neighborCellBalls.

                // But this will include pairs from the same cell twice (when dx=0, dy=0).

                // To avoid that, when dx=0 and dy=0, only check each pair once.

                // Maybe better to do this:

                // For the current cell's balls, check against all balls in neighbor cells, including itself.

                // But to prevent checking a ball against itself, and to avoid duplicates between pairs.

                // So for each ballA in currentCellBalls:

                // For each ballB in neighborCellBalls:

                // if ballA is before ballB in the list, then check.

                // Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

                // Alternatively, just proceed, and in the inner loops, check ballA != ballB, and process each pair once.

                // Maybe for the current cell and neighbor cell:

                // For each ballA in currentCellBalls:

                // For each ballB in neighborCellBalls:

                // if (ballA === ballB) continue;

                // check collision between A and B.

                // But this will process each pair twice (once when A is in current and B in neighbor, and vice versa).

                // So to avoid that, perhaps only process when (ballA comes before ballB in the array?) Not sure.

                // Alternatively, just proceed and let the collision response handle it.

                // Since the collision response is symmetric, it's okay to process each pair twice, but that's inefficient.

                // Hmm, perhaps this is manageable for now, but may need optimization.

                // Proceeding:

                for (var i = 0; i < currentCellBalls.length; i++) {

                    var ballA = currentCellBalls[i];

                    for (var j = 0; j < neighborCellBalls.length; j++) {

                        var ballB = neighborCellBalls[j];

                        if (ballA === ballB) continue; // skip same ball

                        // Check if they are colliding.

                        checkCollision(ballA, ballB);

                    }

                }

            }

        }

    }

}

Wait, but this approach might have overlapping checks. For example, when cell (x,y) and neighbor (x+1,y) are processed, the pair is checked in both cells. But perhaps it's manageable for now.

Alternatively, to avoid processing the same pair twice, perhaps only process when the current cell's index is less than the neighbor's cell indices, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, just proceed and let the collision function handle it once, but in the collision function, we can mark that the pair has been processed.

Alternatively, in the collision function, when two balls collide, we can process the collision once, but since we might check the same pair multiple times, we need to ensure it's handled only once.

Hmm, perhaps the simplest way is to proceed and process each pair multiple times, but in the collision function, the actual collision response is idempotent. Wait no, because when two balls collide, their velocities are changed, so processing the same pair twice would cause incorrect results.

Therefore, this approach is flawed. Need to find a way to process each pair only once.

Hmm, perhaps the way to do it is to, for each cell and its adjacent cells, only process pairs where the current cell's index is less than or equal to the neighbor's cell indices, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid approach is not worth the effort for this problem, and just proceed with O(n^2) for 50 balls. Let me see: 50 balls would have 50*49/2 = 1225 pairs. Each pair requires distance calculation and collision check. Maybe that's manageable with some optimizations.

Let me think: in JavaScript, even 1000 operations per frame might be okay. Let's try that first, and see if performance is okay.

So, for the ball-to-ball collision detection:

After updating all balls' positions and handling walls, loop through all pairs of balls:

for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {

    for (let j = i+1; j < balls.length; j++) {

        const a = balls[i];

        const b = balls[j];

        // compute dx, dy between centers

        const dx = a.x - b.x;

        const dy = a.y - b.y;

        const distSquared = dx*dx + dy*dy;

        const rSum = a.r + b.r;

        if (distSquared < rSum*rSum) {

            // collision detected.

            handleCollision(a, b);

        }

    }

}

This way, each pair is checked once. That's O(n^2/2), which for 50 balls is 1225 checks. Maybe manageable.

But for 50 balls, that's 1225 checks each frame. Let's see: in JavaScript, even 10,000 operations per frame is okay. So this might be okay. Maybe proceed with this approach first, and see.

So, perhaps for the initial version, just use the O(n^2) approach, and if performance is bad, then optimize with a grid.

Now, the handleCollision function.

Implementing the elastic collision equations.

First, compute the normal vector between the two balls.

dx = a.x - b.x;

dy = a.y - b.y;

distance = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);

// if distance is zero, they are the same point, skip.

if (distance === 0) continue;

nx = dx / distance;

ny = dy / distance;

// Compute relative velocity along the normal.

var vRel = ( (a.vx - b.vx)*nx + (a.vy - b.vy)*ny );

// Compute impulse.

const COR = 0.8; // Coefficient of restitution (damping factor)

const J = -(1 + COR) * vRel / ( (1/a.mass) + (1/b.mass) );

// Apply impulse.

const invMassA = 1/a.mass;

const invMassB = 1/b.mass;

a.vx -= J * invMassA * nx;

a.vy -= J * invMassA * ny;

b.vx += J * invMassB * nx;

b.vy += J * invMassB * ny;

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the equations.

Alternatively, using the standard elastic collision formulas:

The change in velocity for each ball is:

deltaV1 = ( (2 * m2) / (m1 + m2) ) * ( (v2 - v1) • n ) * n

Wait, here's a better approach.

The standard formulas for elastic collision in 2D are:

Let’s denote:

m1 = a.mass;

m2 = b.mass;

v1 = [a.vx, a.vy];

v2 = [b.vx, b.vy];

The normal vector n is (dx, dy) normalized.

The relative velocity between the two is v1 - v2.

The component of the relative velocity along n is (v1 - v2) • n.

The impulse is J = -( (1 + COR) * (v1 - v2) • n ) / ( (1/m1) + (1/m2) )

Then, the velocity changes are:

v1 += (J/m1) * n;

v2 -= (J/m2) * n;

Wait, perhaps that's the correct approach.

Wait, let me rederive it.

The impulse J is applied in the direction of n. The total impulse must satisfy the conservation of momentum and the restitution condition.

The formula for J is:

J = ( -(1 + COR) * ( (v2 - v1) • n ) ) / ( (1/m1) + (1/m2) )

Wait, perhaps I need to recheck.

Alternatively, here's a resource: 

The impulse J is given by:

J = ( - (1 + COR) * (v1 - v2) • n ) / ( (1/m1) + (1/m2) )

Then, the change in velocity for each ball is:

deltaV1 = (J / m1) * n

deltaV2 = -(J / m2) * n 

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, the impulse is applied to both balls. The first ball receives +J in the direction of n, and the second receives -J in the same direction.

Wait, no: the impulse on A is J * n, and on B is -J * n ?

Wait, the total impulse must be equal and opposite.

So, the velocity change for A is (J / m1) * n,

and for B is (-J / m2) * n ?

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

deltaV1 = (J / m1) * n;

deltaV2 = (-J / m2) * n;

Wait, but let me think:

The impulse on A is J * n, so deltaV1 = (J * n) / m1.

The impulse on B is -J * n, so deltaV2 = (-J * n)/m2.

Yes, that way, the total momentum change is (J/m1 - J/m2) * n, but the denominator in J's formula is (1/m1 + 1/m2) so that the total momentum is conserved.

Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

So in code:

const J = ( - (1 + COR) * ( (a.vx - b.vx)*nx + (a.vy - b.vy)*ny ) ) / ( (1/a.mass) + (1/b.mass) );

Then,

a.vx += (J / a.mass) * nx;

a.vy += (J / a.mass) * ny;

b.vx -= (J / b.mass) * nx;

b.vy -= (J / b.mass) * ny;

Wait, no, because:

Wait, the J is the impulse applied to A, so deltaV1 is (J * nx)/m1, (J * ny)/m1.

The impulse on B is -J, so deltaV2 is (-J * nx)/m2, (-J * ny)/m2.

Wait, so:

a.vx += (J * nx)/a.mass;

a.vy += (J * ny)/a.mass;

b.vx += (-J * nx)/b.mass;

b.vy += (-J * ny)/b.mass;
